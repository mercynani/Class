#assign students into groups A,B,C 
#obj is to maximise the chance that each group does well on the project
#decision variables xij (i=1,2,3....11 j=a,b,c)
#objective function includes parameters Availability, Degree, Skills, Experience
#each student must be assigned to a group
#Constraint: grp cannot have less that 3 and more than 4 students
#constraint: Availability <=5
#constraint: undergraduate degree <=5
#constraint: Presentation skill <=5
#constraint: Prior experience <=5
