definining the variables
xi = quantity purchased in month i <= 200
yi = quantity purchased in month i > 200
si = stock at the end of month i
bi = 1 if > 200 units are purchased on month i
di = monthly demand
where i = month 1,2,3,4
monthly total purchase = xi + yi
obj funct = cost/unit xi + cost/unit - 2 yi + 2stock
constraints
