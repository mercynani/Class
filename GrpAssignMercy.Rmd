#assign students into groups A,B,C 
#obj is to maximise the chance that each group does well on the project
#decision variables xij (i=1,2,3....11 j=A,B,C)
#objective function includes parameters Availability, Degree, Skills, Experience
#constraints: Each project must be assigned to 3 or 4 students
#Constraint: grp annot have less that 3 and more than 4 students
#constraint: Availability(f) <=5
#constraint: undergraduate degree(g) <=5
#constraint: Presentation skill(h) <=5
#constraint: Prior experience(I) <=5
